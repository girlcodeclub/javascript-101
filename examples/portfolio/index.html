        <p>
            JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language that makes websites interactive.
            If HTML is the "skeleton" of a webpage and CSS is the "skin", then
            <strong>JavaScript is the "muscles"</strong> that make it move.
            It's <em>one of the most popular languages</em> in the world.

        <h3>Why We're Learning It</h3>
        
        <!-- An unordered (bulleted) list -->
        <ul>
            <li>It's the only language that runs in all web browsers.</li>
            <li>You can use it to build websites, apps, and even games.</li>
            <li>It's a great "first" text-based language after Scratch.</li>
            <li>You can use it to build server-side code (with Node.js).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How It Relates to Scratch</h3>
        
        <!-- An ordered (numbered) list -->
        <ol>
            <li>Scratch uses visual blocks; JavaScript uses text commands.</li>
            <li>"When Green Flag Clicked" is an **Event**, just like `onclick` in JS.</li>
            <li>"Make a Variable" is a **Variable**, just like `let myName = "Thalia"` in JS.</li>
            <li>"If/Then" blocks are **Conditionals**, just like `if ( ... ) { ... }` in JS.</li>
        </ol>
